# device-backend

All backend software underneath the PlanktoScope device's standard API.

Note: this is a work-in-progress refactor and is not yet ready for general use.

## Introduction

This repository contains the PlanktoScope's backend software services implementing the PlanktoScope's hardware support, application logic, and public API. The current backend functionality can be divided into two categories:

- [Device control](./control/README.md): controls the PlanktoScope's sensors and actuators, producing raw data. Currently, device control consists of:
  - Hardware abstraction layers: implements a simple, mostly-uniform internal API on different underlying hardware devices, for the application-level hardware controller to be used with different hardware implementations of PlanktoScope designs.
  - Application-level controller: provides device behaviors (such as stop-flow imaging) generalizable across different generations of PlanktoScopes. In software engineering jargon, this is the "business logic" of the PlanktoScope hardware-control software.
  - API adapter: exposes the application-level controller with a standard public API for other software clients to use.
- Data processing: transforms raw data into processed data for downstream analysis and quantification. Currently, data processing functionality consists of:
  - [Object isolation and segmentation](./processing/segmenter/README.md): detects objects from camera frames and creates an image for each isolated object, with the background removed.
