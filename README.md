## What are Plankton?

_"Drifting endlessly, midway between the sea of air above and the depths of the abyss below, these strange creatures and the marine inflorescence that sustains them are called 'plankton' â€” the wanderers"_ - **Rachel Carson**

Helping fix 30-50% of the worlds carbon dioxide and providing the foundation of a global food chain, plankton comprise the largest daily movement of biomass in the world as they traverse the oceans. The shapes, colors, and movements of these billions of creatures are as vast as the seas that sustains them. Understanding plankton is crucial to understanding the world around us, and the effect we have on that world. A hurdle for this type of study has been the sheer scale of area to explore, and the limited resources of research fleets and specialized equipment. By developing a way to scale up high quality visual exploration and documentation we can greatly increase our understanding of the complicated web of life around us, and how we are in turn impacting it.


## What is a PlanktoScope?

The **PlanktoScope** is a modular, open-source hardware and software platform that allows for high-throughput quantitative imaging of plankton samples in aquatic biology and ecology. Its small size, ease of use, and low cost make it suitable for deployment in a range of applications, including the monitoring of laboratory cultures or natural micro-plankton communities. It can be controlled from any WiFi-enabled device, and its versatility allows for rapid reconfiguration to match the evolving needs of the user.

# Key Features
Here are some key features of the PlanktoScope:

1.  Low cost: The PlanktoScope is designed to be affordable, with parts costing under $1000.
2.  Modular: The PlanktoScope is modular, meaning it can be easily reconfigured to meet the changing needs of users.
3.  Open-source: The PlanktoScope is based on open-source hardware and software, making it accessible to a wide community of engineers, researchers, and citizens.
4.  Versatility: The PlanktoScope is versatile, and can be used to study a variety of plankton types, including laboratory cultures and natural micro-plankton communities.
5.  High-throughput: The PlanktoScope is capable of high-throughput quantitative imaging, allowing users to analyze large numbers of samples quickly and efficiently.
6.  WiFi-enabled: The PlanktoScope can be controlled from any WiFi-enabled device, making it easy to use and deploy in a variety of settings.
7.  Small size: The PlanktoScope is small and portable, making it easy to transport and use in the field.
8.  Ease of use: The PlanktoScope is designed to be easy to use, with instructions for assembly and use available on the PlanktoScope website.

## How do I build one?
You can access the complete documentation on [Read The Docs](https://planktonscope.readthedocs.io/).

## How do I get involved?
There are several ways to join the development effort, share your progress with your build or just ask for help.

We are using slack as a communication platform between interested parties. You can [request to join by filling this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcod-avpzWVmWj42_hW1v2mMSHm0DAGXHxVECFig2dnKHxGQ/viewform).

This repository is also a good way to get involved. Please fill in an issue if you witnessed a bug in the software or hardware. If you are able, you can also join the development effort. Look through the [issues opened](https://github.com/PlanktonPlanet/PlanktoScope/labels/good%20first%20issue) and choose one that piques your interest. Let us know you want to work on it in the comments, we may even be able to guide your beginnings around the code.
