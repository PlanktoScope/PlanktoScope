3. [ ] "Stop" stops movement

**Pump**

1. [ ] "Backward" pumps anticlockwise
2. [ ] "Forward" pumps clockwise
3. [ ] "Flowrate" impacts "Backward" speed
4. [ ] "Flowrate" impacts "Forward" speed
5. [ ] "Volume" impacts "Backward" duration
6. [ ] "Volume" impacts "Forward" duration
7. [ ] "Stop" stops the pump

**Bubbler** (v3 only)

1. Connect tube, needle and plunge in a glass of water
2. [ ] `25%` generates slow bubbles
3. [ ] `50%` generates bubbles faster than `25%`
