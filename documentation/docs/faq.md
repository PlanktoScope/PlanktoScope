# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ has been compiled to answer common questions about the PlanktoScope project and how you can get involved. We hope you find it useful and we look forward to working with you to advance our knowledge of the oceans!

## Can I purchase a PlanktoScope?

You can purchase a PlanktoScope - either as a kit of parts to assemble yourself or as a fully preassembled device - from a small business called [FairScope](https://www.fairscope.com/), which was started by the inventor of the PlanktoScope in order to make PlanktoScopes easier to obtain.

## How much money does a PlanktoScope cost?

For pricing of PlanktoScopes and PlanktoScope assembly kits from FairScope, refer to [the FairScope website](https://www.fairscope.com/). If you purchase all the parts to build a single PlanktoScope yourself, the cost of parts can be as low as $400 or $800 depending on the type of PlanktoScope you build.

## I want to build a PlanktoScope, where should I start?

If you have the technical know-how then you can build it yourself; the required information can be found here in the documentation. Let others know about your intention to do this and say hello in our [Slack Channel](https://planktoscope.slack.com/), so that you can ask for help when you encounter issues.

## Where do I get support or find the necessary tools to build PlanktoScope?

To find the necessary tools and knowledge to produce the PlanktoScope, consider visiting a [Fablab](https://fablabs.io/labs) or [Hackspaces](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) in your region. These organizations often have a culture of openness and may be willing to support you with your project.

And if you have specific questions or problems, you can always report them in the [Slack Channel](https://planktoscope.slack.com/) and in the best case you will find someone there who can support you.

## I am looking for an older version of the PlanktoScope where the housing could still be manufactured with a laser cutter. Where can I find the corresponding design files?

Even though the development is now focused on a more sustainable approach based on recycled wood, and which has better optics. You can find DIY purchasing information [from the PlanktoScope website](https://www.planktoscope.org/replicate/get-your-kit), and you can find DIY assembly information [also from the PlanktoScope website](https://www.planktoscope.org/replicate/assemble-your-kit).
