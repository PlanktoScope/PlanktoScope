# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ has been compiled to answer common questions about the PlanktoScope project and how you can get involved. We hope you find it useful and we look forward to working with you to advance our knowledge of the oceans!

## Can I purchase a PlanktoScope?

You can purchase a PlanktoScope - either as a kit of parts to assemble yourself or as a fully preassembled device - from a small business called [FairScope](https://www.fairscope.com/), which was started by the inventor of the PlanktoScope in order to make PlanktoScopes easier to obtain. For more information, please refer to our page on [how to obtain a PlanktoScope](setup/index.md).

## How much does it cost to get a PlanktoScope?

If you don't want a long answer, then you should [request a quote](https://www.fairscope.com/get-a-quote) from FairScope's website. If you want a summary of the longer answer detailed below: if you are not satisfied with FairScope's pricing, then the cost of getting a PlanktoScope by procuring and assembling your own PlanktoScope assembly kit will depend on many factors which only you can assess; as you will see below, there are good reasons for the pricing of PlanktoScopes offered by FairScope.

### As a procure-it-yourself and build-it-yourself kit

If you will be making your own kit of PlanktoScope parts to assemble into a PlanktoScope, the total cost of procuring a PlanktoScope will depend on various decisions you make and on various resources you may or may not have access to, including the following factors:

1. Which version of the PlanktoScope hardware design you will build: the total cost of the bill of materials (BOM) for the PlanktoScope v2.1 hardware is lower than the cost for more recent hardware versions, which make various design improvements and select different components in order to achieve significantly higher imaging quality.
2. Whether you will substitute or omit any components or materials: the total cost of the bill of materials will depend on the prices of the components you select; you are free to choose different components depending on local availability and pricing, and depending on your organization's procurement policies for different online marketplaces (e.g. Amazon vs. AliExpress). These choices will probably affect the quality of the resulting hardware, and they will definitely affect the BOM cost. You can also omit certain components if you don't need the functionalities they provide.
3. The cost of fabricating the mechanical structure of the PlanktoScope: if you don't already have access to equipment for laser-cutting (in the PlanktoScope v2.1 hardware design) or CNC milling (in subsequent hardware designs), such as through a local workshop or makerspace, then you will probably need to pay a laser-cutting or CNC-milling service to fabricate those parts for you.
4. Your level of technical expertise with hardware and software bring-up, and with the PlanktoScope's systems: especially if you have little prior experience with the PlanktoScope, you will need to spend a nontrivial amount of time in BOM procurement, assembly, and bring-up (including first-time troubleshooting and calibration) of the PlanktoScopes you build.
5. The value of the time you spend on building your PlanktoScope and getting it to work: you may need to account for the costs (whether financial costs of labor, or opportunity costs of time spent) of each hour of such work.
6. The number of PlanktoScopes you will be building: this determines whether you can take advantage of any bulk pricing for components in the bill of materials.

Because these factors depend heavily on your particular situation, we cannot provide a useful general estimate of costs for a fully do-it-yourself approach to getting a PlanktoScope. In one anecdotal experience of having PhD students build ten PlanktoScopes with the v2.1 hardware design, with certain components omitted or substituted, with free access to a laser cutter and all other equipment required for hardware assembly, and with no prior experience in building PlanktoScopes (but expert-level prior experience in hardware and software bring-up and troubleshooting), each v2.1 PlanktoScope:

- had a final BOM cost (excluding shipping costs) of USD ~$400-500 per unit; this BOM cost excludes the prices of parts which were initially ordered and then had to be substituted with other parts for the final BOM due to problems discovered in their interactions with other parts which had been substituted in the initial BOM; however, this cost also includes the inflated price of Raspberry Pi 4 computers during the 2021-2023 Raspberry Pi shortage.
- took a full working day to fabricate and assemble each unit
- required a total of a few working days of initial setup and troubleshooting across all ten units

Compared to the above example, you should expect a higher total cost for you to procure your own PlanktoScope assembly kit and assemble it into a fully-functionality PlanktoScope - especially if this will be your first attempt with the process. If you aim to make your own kit of PlanktoScope parts to assemble into a machine on your own, you can prevent frustration and disappointment by managing your expectations about the PlanktoScope project: think of the it as a rough recipe for you to spend significant amounts of time tinkering with and learning from, rather than a finished product.

### As a product from FairScope

Alternatively, if you purchase PlanktoScopes from FairScope, it will arrive as a finished product. To get a price estimate for purchasing PlanktoScopes from FairScope, you will need to [request a quote](https://www.fairscope.com/get-a-quote) from their website; the price will be higher than USD $500, because:

1. FairScope handles all the factors listed above (in the "As a procure-it-yourself and build-it-yourself kit" section), including: selection of suppliers for BOM components; human labor and accumulated expertise for procurement, assembly, and bring-up of new machines; and maintenance of fabrication/assembly equipment.
2. It includes the value provided by FairScope in delivering PlanktoScopes which consist of a well-controlled set of parts and which are tested, validated, and calibrated both for machine performance and for comparability of collected data.
3. It includes a fraction of the value which FairScope will continue to provide to you over the lifetime of each PlanktoScope, in the form of ongoing open-source maintenance of the PlanktoScope's software - with bug fixes and new features delivered as software updates which you can easily install on your PlanktoScope.
4. It includes the cost of labor provided by FairScope to develop open-source design improvements to the PlanktoScope's hardware.
5. It supports ongoing development of additional hardware modules which will add new capabilities when combined with existing PlanktoScopes.

Even accounting for these considerations, the price of PlanktoScopes offered by FairScope is still significantly lower than the prices of other flow-imaging instruments sold for use in scientific research. If you are unsure whether you'll be able to afford a PlanktoScope from FairScope (e.g. because you are from a country, institution, organization, or community where the standard prices would be infeasible), we recommend that you explain your financial situation and your intended use for PlanktoScopes in your request for a pricing quote from FairScope, to see if FairScope may be able to apply any pricing adjustments for equitable global access to PlanktoScopes.

## Where do I get support or find the necessary tools to build PlanktoScope?

To find the necessary tools and knowledge to produce the PlanktoScope, consider visiting a [Fablab](https://fablabs.io/labs) or [Hackspaces](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) in your region. These organizations often have a culture of openness and may be willing to support you with your project.

And if you have specific questions or problems, you can always report them in the [Slack Channel](https://planktoscope.slack.com/) and in the best case you will find someone there who can support you.
