# Maintenance and Repair

Instructions for maintaining and repairing the PlanktoScope.

## Cleaning the optics

* Begin by turning off the microscope and unplugging it from any power source.
  Gently remove any dust or debris using a soft, dry cloth.
* To clean the lenses and other optics, use a lens cleaning solution and a lens cleaning tissue or cloth. Gently wipe the optics in a circular motion, starting from the center and working outward. Avoid applying too much pressure or using a rough cloth, as this can scratch or damage the optics.
* Once you have finished cleaning the optics, use a dry cloth to remove any excess moisture or cleaning solution.
