# PlanktoScope Hardware

You are viewing a copy of the PlanktoScope project documentation without the hardware setup guides, probably because you're viewing an offline, reduced-size copy of the PlanktoScope documentation served by your PlanktoScope. You should go to an [online copy of the PlanktoScope documentation](https://docs.planktoscope.community) to find the hardware setup guides. Or, if you can temporarily [connect your PlanktoScope to the internet](../../operation/networking.md#connect-your-planktoscope-to-the-internet), then you can [download the hardware setup guides to your PlanktoScope](../../operation/software-customization.md#planktoscope-documentation-site) for future offline access.
