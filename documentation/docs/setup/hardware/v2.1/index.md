# Hardware v2.1

This page will help you to build the v2.1 hardware for a PlanktoScope.

## Make an assembly kit

If you do not already have an assembly kit, you will need to [make a kit for yourself](kit/index.md). Note: you will need to [set up the PlanktoScope software](../../software/index.md) on the micro-SD card of your PlanktoScope's Raspberry Pi, as part of the assembly kit.

You should be aware that some of the parts required for the kit, especially the peristaltic pump, are no longer commercially available; you will have to identify alternatives to substitute for those parts.

## Assemble a PlanktoScope from a kit

Once you have an assembly kit, you will need to [assemble it](assembly/index.md) into a PlanktoScope.

## Next steps

Once you have assembled your PlanktoScope, you can proceed to our [operation guide](../../../operation/index.md)Â to learn how to operate your PlanktoScope.
