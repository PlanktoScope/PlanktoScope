# Hardware v2.1

This page will help you to build the v2.1 hardware for a PlanktoScope.

## Make an assembly kit

Currently, you can find the instructions for making an assembly kit at [the PlanktoScope website](https://www.planktoscope.org/replicate/get-your-kit).

You should be aware that some of the parts required for the kit, especially the peristaltic pump, are no longer commercially available; you will have to identify alternatives to substitute for those parts.

## Assemble a PlanktoScope from a kit

Currently, you can find step-by-step instructions for assembling a PlanktoScope from a kit at [the old documentation site for PlanktoScope](https://planktoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly_guide/).

## Next steps

After assembling your PlanktoScope hardware, you will need to [set up the PlanktoScope software](../../software/index.md) on the micro-SD card of your PlanktoScope's Raspberry Pi. Then you can proceed to our [operation guide](http://localhost:8000/operation/)Â to learn how to operate your PlanktoScope.
