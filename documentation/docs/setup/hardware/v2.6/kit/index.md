We tried to have the most easy-to-supply components, you still may have to adapt and research for new suppliers according to product availability and your location.
If you find some local alternative please share your custom BOM to our GitHub Discussions thread for [v2.6 Localized Hardware BOMs](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/PlanktoScope/discussions/297), so that other members of our community can learn from your work!

In the following sections we will go more in detail:

- on the possibility to machined on your own the Mechanical Structure
- on the documentations and assembly steps to manufacture the PlanktoScope HAT V1.3


## Mechanical Structure

In order to create the PlanktoScope case, parts were designed to be machined with a CNC milling machine. 
The configuration of the CNC milling machine plays a crucial role in the machining process and can significantly affect the quality and efficiency of the production of a workpiece. You will have to adapt the file to your machine as every CNC milling machine gets its characteristics: feed rate and diameter adjustment according to your machine and selected end mill. 
And don't forget safety, use your nicest protective glasses! :-)

### Manufacturing file

Here you can find the .dxf file to create the program on a CNC milling machine. If you do not have the equipment and/or the knowledge do not hesitate to contact local suppliers and fablabs. 


[!NOTE]
   Depending on stock availability, FairScope can also be considered as a supplier.

### Material
A great variety of material can be used to create the PlanktoScope case. You need to be sure that it can be machined easily and has great durability in harsh conditions. Here you can find 2 examples of used material: Bamboo Plywood & Valchromat.

1. Bamboo Plywood

Bamboo plywood is a renewable, eco-friendly material made from layers of bamboo strips pressed together. It is known for its strength, durability, and resistance to warping, making it ideal for furniture. Bamboo plywood is lightweight, versatile, and more sustainable than traditional hardwoods, as bamboo grows quickly and requires fewer resources to cultivate.
FairScope is using Bamboo Plywood for V2.6.

2. Valchromat

Valchromat is a wood-based composite material made from recycled wood fibers and colored with natural dyes. It is known for its durability, resistance to moisture and decay, and ability to be machined and finished in a similar way to solid wood.


### Finnish of the plates

After your wonderful milling process, remove all dust and remain of the milling and machining.

Here you can use your favorite finishing according to the selected material. Be sure that it remains as environmentally friendly as possible.

!!! note:

	For example, FairScope uses Rubio Monocoat Plus. It is a wood finishing product that is designed to provide a durable, natural-looking finish to wood surfaces. It is made from plant-based oils and pigments, which give it a transparent finish that enhances the natural beauty of the wood.

Dry all parts and store them for the assembly process.

## PlanktoScope Hat 1.3 PCB

Welcome to the PCB production manual for the PlanktoScope Hat 1.3!


Photo du Hat recto verso


A **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)** is a vital component of electronic devices, providing physical support and electrical connections for components. The PCB production process involves three main stages:

1. Design: Engineers use software (e.g., Altium, KiCad) to create the schematic and layout, optimizing component placement, trace paths, and layers.

2. Fabrication: Copper and fiberglass sheets are processed via etching, plating, drilling, and layer stacking to form the circuit structure.

3. Assembly: Components are placed and soldered either manually or with automated systems.

Components used on PCBs are either **Thru-Hole** (leads pass through the board, ideal for durability) or **Surface Mount** (soldered directly on the surface, suited for compact designs). The choice depends on the device’s requirements.

You will find on the following files the full documentation to ask for a quotation to your electronic prototypist.

!!! note
	
    Depending on stock availability, FairScope can also be considered as a supplier.

We recommend asking your prototypist to assemble all the thru-hole components. In order to reduce costs and if you feel like doing it, you can assemble them manually, be really cautious of the correct solderings.

The assembly of the Drivers TMC 5160 and the Axial Fan assembly are here proposed in parallel and DIY. No worries, everything is explain in [Assembly of the Drivers TMC 5160](#assembly-of-the-drivers-tmc-5160) & [Assembly of the Axial Fan](#assembly-of-the-axial-fan). 
They are not included as Thru-Hole components list for the prototypiste.

#### Configuration

The following configuration parameters can be used for the production of the PCB.
