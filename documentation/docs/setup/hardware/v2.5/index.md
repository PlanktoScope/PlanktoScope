# Hardware v2.5

This page will help you to build the v2.5 hardware for a PlanktoScope.

## Make an assembly kit

If you do not already have an assembly kit, you will need to [make a kit for yourself](kit/index.md).

## Assemble a PlanktoScope from a kit

Once you have an assembly kit, you will need to [assemble it](assembly/index.md) into a PlanktoScope.

## Next steps

If you assembled your PlanktoScope from a kit provided by FairScope, you can proceed to our [operation guide](http://localhost:8000/operation/)Â to learn how to operate your PlanktoScope. Otherwise, you will first need to [set up the PlanktoScope software](../../software/index.md) on the micro-SD card of your PlanktoScope's Raspberry Pi.
