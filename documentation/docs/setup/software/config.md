# Post-Installation Configuration

After installing the PlanktoScope software onto your PlanktoScope, you will need to configure the software to match your PlanktoScope hardware and your operational requirements.

Currently, all post-installation configuration is performed in the PlanktoScope software's Node-RED dashboard. To access it, you should first open the PlanktoScope's landing page in your web browser, e.g. following the instructions in the [software installation guide](standard-install.md#connect-to-the-planktoscope). Then you should click the "Node-RED dashboard" link at the top of the "Browser applications" section of the landing page.

## Hardware Version

The first time you start the PlanktoScope, you will need to select the hardware version of your PlanktoScope for the PlanktoScope software to match the actual configuration of your PlanktoScope hardware. To do this, open the Node-RED dashboard. You should see a homepage with a drop-down menu to select your PlanktoScope hardware version. You should select the correct version for your PlanktoScope. After you select a hardware version, the PlanktoScope will show the Node-RED dashboard's normal homepage navigation buttons; you should also wait several seconds for the PlanktoScope software to restart and load the updated hardware settings.

## Next steps

Now that you have configured the PlanktoScope software, you can proceed to our guide on how to [operate your PlanktoScope](../../operation/index.md).
