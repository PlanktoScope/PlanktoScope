👁 Locate the **panel S1** and discover the 5 differents **Parts F, P, K, J** and **I**.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-005.jpg](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-005.jpg)
🎬 Flip your **panel S1**.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-006.jpg](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-006.jpg)
🔴 Locate the outer **tabs** on the edges of the different **Parts**. These are typically small projections of material that are used to secure the case parts to the panels.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-009.jpg](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-009.jpg)

- Position your **razor blade** on the tab as close to the piece as possible to avoid residual tab after cutting.
- Press firmly on the razor blade, being very careful with your finger, to cut your first tab.
- Make sure you don't damage your table by placing a flat, rigid support under the **S1 panel**.
- Keep going with the other tabs of this piece F.

Once all of the tabs are cut, gently lift the case parts away from the panels. If the case parts are stuck or difficult to remove, you may need to gently wiggle or pry them loose using a flat tool such as a screwdriver.

!!! warning

    Be extremely careful because this is very sharp.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-011.jpg](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-011.jpg)
