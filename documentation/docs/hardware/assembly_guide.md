![planktoscope-assembly-004.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-004.png)
👁 Locate the **panel S1** and discover the 5 differents **Parts F, P, K, J** and **I**.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-005.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-005.png)
🎬 Flip your **panel S1**.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-006.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-006.png)
🔴 Locate the outer **tabs** on the edges of the different **Parts**. These are typically small projections of material that are used to secure the case parts to the panels.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-007.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-007.png)
Gather all the necessary tools. You will need the B2 🟠 **Razor blade** to cut the tabs.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-008.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-008.png)

- 🟣 Use the **razor blade** to cut the outer tabs located on the edges of the different Parts
- ❌ Do not cut the inner tabs present inside the different Parts for now and focus on the outer tabs attaching the Parts to the main panel.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-009.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-009.png)

- Position your **razor blade** on the tab as close to the piece as possible to avoid residual tab after cutting.
- Press firmly on the razor blade, being very careful with your finger, to cut your first tab.
- Make sure you don't damage your table by placing a flat, rigid support under the **S1 panel**.
- Keep going with the other tabs of this piece F.

Once all of the tabs are cut, gently lift the case parts away from the panels. If the case parts are stuck or difficult to remove, you may need to gently wiggle or pry them loose using a flat tool such as a screwdriver.

!!! warning

    Be extremely careful because this is very sharp.

---

![planktoscope-assembly-011.png](../images/assembly_guide/planktoscope-assembly-011.png)

Once you have removed your **Part** from the main panel by cutting off all the tabs holding it, inspect it for potential residual tabs.
