# Installation

This document explains how the [PlanktoScope OS](../architecture/os.md)'s installation process works, as a companion to our [non-standard installation guide](../../../setup/software/nonstandard-install.md) which carries out the process explained below.

The installation process is initiated by downloading and [running the *installation bootstrap script*](../../../setup/software/nonstandard-install.md#run-the-installation-script), which in turn downloads and runs the *distro setup scripts* according to the installation parameters provided to the installation bootstrap script.
