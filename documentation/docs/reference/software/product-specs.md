# Product Specifications

The PlanktoScope OS includes all software which needs to run on the PlanktoScope's hardware to provide the [overall functionality of a PlanktoScope](../index.md). Product specifications for the PlanktoScope OS are listed below for ranges of software version numbers. To see software versions listed individually in chronological order, refer to the [project release notes](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/PlanktoScope/releases) or the [software changelog](./changelog.md). To understand how to interpret software version numbers, refer to our description of the PlanktoScope OS's [version numbering system](./release-process.md#version-numbering).

## v2025.0.0

Specs for v2025.0.0 are the same as in v2024.0.0, except for the following sections:

- Base operating system: the distro has changed from Raspberry Pi OS 11 (bullseye) to Raspberry Pi OS 12 (bookworm).
- Supported optional addons: additional support for up to one USB Wi-Fi adapter (with a compatible Wi-Fi chipset).
- Forwards-incompatible: now able to run on the Raspberry Pi 5 computer.

### Functionalities

Regular operation:

Miscellaneous data sources:

- Up to one Adafruit Ultimate GPS HAT: for system clock synchronization, and for automatic detection of GPS location coordinates.
