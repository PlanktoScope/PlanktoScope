# Planktoscope MQTT API Reference

The MQTT API is the primary programming interface for controlling the PlanktoScope. The API is served by the PlanktoScope's Python backend, and data is sent across the API with the following architecture:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    API[API Client] -->|Command| Broker[MQTT Broker]
    Broker -->|Command| Backend[Python Backend]
    Backend -->|Status Update| Broker[MQTT Broker]
    Broker -->|Status Update| API
```

Most messages in the MQTT API are organized according to a request-response pattern in which the API client sends a *command* as a request to take some action, and then the Python backend sends one or more responses as *status updates* about how the Python backend's state has changed as a result of the command:

- **API clients** send commands to the Python backend (via the MQTT broker), and receive status updates from the Python backend (also via the MQTT broker). The PlanktoScope's Node-RED dashboard is an API client, but other programs are also allowed to act as API clients.
- The **MQTT broker** passes commands and status updates between the API client(s) and the Python backend. The MQTT broker runs on the PlanktoScope and accepts connections from API clients on port 1883.
- The **Python backend** handles commands, takes actions (e.g. changing the state of hardware actuators), and publishes status updates both in response to commands and in response to changes in internal state. Currently, parts of the Python backend also act as MQTT API clients to other parts of the Python backend.

Every MQTT message in the PlanktoScope's MQTT API is published on a specific *topic*, which is a slash-delimited path of strings (e.g. `actuator/pump`). Every MQTT message in the PlanktoScope's MQTT API carries a *payload*, which is a JSON object serialized as a string:

- Messages which are commands usually specify the type of command in an `action` field of the payload object; other fields of the payload object are parameters of the command.
- Messages which are status updates have a single field in the payload object, `status`, which is a string containing a status or error message.

In the rest of this reference document, we organize our description of the MQTT API into sections corresponding to distinct functionalities of the Python backend:

## Pump

The Pump API controls the movement of fluid through the PlanktoScope:

- **MQTT topics for commands**: `actuator/pump`
- **MQTT topics for status updates**: `status/pump`
- **Commands**: `move`, `stop`

### `move` command

The `move` command initiates movement of fluid through the PlanktoScope by driving the PlanktoScope pump's stepper motor. For example, this command makes the pump move 10 mL of fluid forwards through the PlanktoScope's fluidic path, at a rate of 1 mL/min:

```json
{
  "action": "move",
  "direction": "FORWARD",
  "volume": 10,
  "flowrate": 1
}
```

The `move` command has the following parameters:

| Field       | Description                                                        | Type   | Accepted Values            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------- |
| `action`    | Specifies the `move` command.                                      | string | `move`                     |
| `direction` | Direction to run the pump.                                         | string | `FORWARD`, `BACKWARD`      |
| `volume`    | Total volume of sample to pump before stopping automatically (mL). | float  | 0 < `volume`               |
| `flowrate`  | Speed of pumping (mL/min).                                         | float  | 0 < `flowrate` ≤ 45 mL/min |

#### `move` command responses

The Python backend can send status updates on the `status/pump` topic, in response to the `move` command. The `status` field of such status updates can have any of the following values:

| Status/Error                                | Cause                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Started`                                   | The pump has started moving in response to a valid `move` command.                                     |
| `Error, the message is missing an argument` | One or more required parameters (`direction`, `volume`, `flowrate`) are missing in the `move` command. |
| `Error, The flowrate should not be == 0`    | An invalid value (0) was provided for the `flowrate` field.                                            |
| `Done`                                      | The pump has successfully stopped after fully pumping the specified volume of sample.                  |

Note: the MQTT API does not yet completely specify error messages in response to invalid values for the `direction`, `volume`, and `flowrate` parameters.

### `stop` command

The `stop` command interrupts any ongoing movement of fluid through the PlanktoScope and cuts off power to the PlanktoScope pump's stepper motor:

```json
{
  "action": "stop"
}
```

## Imager

The Imager API controls image acquisition with the PlanktoScope's hardware, as well as the PlanktoScope's camera:

- **MQTT topics for commands**: `imager/image`
- **MQTT topics for status updates**: `status/imager`
- **Commands**: `settings`, `update_config`, `image`, `stop`

For details on how images are acquired, refer to our technical reference on [sample imaging](../functionalities/sample-imaging.md) in the PlanktoScope.

Generally, commands should be sent in the following order:

1. `settings` command: Configure the camera settings.
2. `update_config` command: Update the dataset metadata for the next image acquisition.
3. `image` command: Initiate image acquisition.
4. `stop` command: Stop any in-progress image acquisition.

### `settings` command

The `settings` command changes the camera settings. The fields `iso`, `shutter_speed`, `white_balance_gain` and `white_balance` are optional - if a field is omitted, its setting will not be changed. Here's an example of a command with values specified for all fields:

```json
{
  "action": "settings",
  "settings": {
    "iso": 100,
    "shutter_speed": 40,
    "white_balance_gain": { "red": 100, "blue": 100 },

#### `update_config` command responses

The Python backend can send status updates on the `status/imager` topic in response to the `update_config` command. The `status` field of such status updates can have any of the following values:

| Status/Error                  | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Config updated`              | The metadata has been successfully updated.                                      |
| `Configuration message error` | The command is missing the required `config` field.                              |
| `Busy`                        | Image acquisition is already in progress, so dataset metadata cannot be changed. |

### `image` command

The `image` command initiates acquisition of one raw image dataset consisting of a specified number of images, via [stop-flow imaging](../functionalities/sample-imaging.md). For example, this command initiates acquisition of 200 images, with 1 mL of sample pumped between each image and an image stabilization period of 0.1 seconds between the end of pumping and the triggering of the image capture for each acquired image:

```json
{
  "action": "image",
  "pump_direction": "FORWARD",
  "volume": 1,
  "nb_frame": 200,
  "sleep": 0.1
}
```

A valid `update_config` command with a unique `(object_date, sample_id, acq_id)` combination must be sent some time before each `image` command. If an `update_config` command has not been sent before the `image` command, the `image` command will trigger a “Started” response status and then do nothing (this is a software bug which needs to be fixed so that an error status is reported instead).

The `image` command has the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                      | Type    | Accepted Values        |

| `volume`         | Volume (in mL) of sample to pump between each captured image.                                                                    | float   | 0 < `volume`           |
| `nb_frame`       | Number of frames to capture.                                                                                                     | integer | 0 < `nb_frame`         |
| `sleep`          | Duration (in s) to wait after pumping has stopped before saving an image, to allow the sample objects to stabilize in the image. | float   | 0 < `sleep`            |

## Segmenter

The Segmenter API controls the processing of acquired images:

- **MQTT topics for commands**: `segmenter/segment`
- **MQTT topics for status updates**: `status/segmenter`, `status/segmenter/object_id`, `status/segmenter/metric`
- **Commands**: `segment`

For details on how images are processed, refer to our technical reference on [image segmentation](../functionalities/segmentation.md) in the PlanktoScope.

### `segment` command

The `segment` command initiates processing of images stored in the specified path, optionally exporting the results to an EcoTaxa-compatible archive. The various `settings` parameters of this command provide control over the behavior of image processing. For example, this command initiates processing of all images in the `/path/to/segment` directory:

```json
{
  "action": "segment",
  "path": "/path/to/segment",
  "settings": {
    "force": false,
    "recursive": true,
    "ecotaxa": true,
    "keep": true
  }
}
```

### `stop` command

The `stop` command interrupts any ongoing image processing. For example:

```json
{
  "action": "stop"
}
```

The `stop` command has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type   | Accepted Values | Description                                |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `action`  | string | "stop"          | Specifies the action to stop segmentation. |

!!! warning
    The functionality for this command has not yet been implemented. Currently an `Interrupted` status is sent as a response on the `segmenter/segment` topic even though no interruption will actual happen.

#### `stop` command responses

The Python backend can send status updates on the `segmenter/segment` topic, in response to the `stop` command. The `status` field of such status updates can have any of the following values:

| Status/Error message | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Interrupted`        | The segmentation process was interrupted. |

### Non-response status updates

The Python backend can send status updates on the `status/segmenter` topic which are not triggered by any command. The `status` field of such status updates can have any of the following values:

| Status/Error | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ready`      | The backend has become ready to respond to Segmenter commands. |
| `Dead`       | The backend will no longer respond to Segmenter commands.      |
