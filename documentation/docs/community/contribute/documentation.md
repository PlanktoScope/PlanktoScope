# Writing Documentation

The source files are in the main [github repository](https://www.github.com/PlanktonPlanet/PlanktoScope), in the `docs` folder.

They are simple [Markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/), that you can edit in any text editor of your choice.

The local development and test is made using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). This allows you to test your documentation changes for styling issues and see what it will look like once rendered.

```sh
hatch run docs:serve
```

After installing mkdocs, you can use `mkdocs serve` in the main folder of this repository to start the development server.

If you want to include pictures and diagrams in the documentation, please set the pictures in a dedicated folder to the name of the page you are creating (for example, if your page is named `expert_setup.md`, please put all the related pictures in the `docs/expert_setup/` folder). Each picture should be named with a simple yet descriptive name, using jpg or png format if possible. Try to limit the size of the file by limiting the resolution to what is necessary for the picture to be clear on screen.

Contributions should be made by creating pull requests on [Github directly](https://github.com/PlanktonPlanet/PlanktoScope/pulls).
