### CNC workflow

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to configure the feed rate and the diameter of the end mill of a CNC milling machine for the production of a workpiece, using the specified tools and configuration:

1. Select the appropriate end mill: The end mill should be selected based on the material and shape of the workpiece, as well as the desired level of precision. For this specific production, the following end mills will be used:

   - 6mm end mill for straight flats
   - 2mm end mill for inner contours
   - 1mm end mill for small holes

2. Determine the feed rate: The feed rate is the speed at which the end mill moves along the surface of the workpiece and is usually measured in millimeters per minute (mm/m). The appropriate feed rate will depend on the diameter of the end mill and the material and thickness of the workpiece. For this specific production, the following feed rates will be used:

   - 1500mm/min for 1-2mm end mills
   - 2500mm/min for 3mm end mills
   - 3500mm/min for 6mm end mills

3. Load the end mill: Once the appropriate end mill has been selected, it can be loaded onto the spindle of the CNC milling machine.

4. Set the workpiece: The workpiece should be securely clamped onto the table of the CNC milling machine.

5. Set the machine parameters: The feed rate and end mill diameter should be entered into the machine's control panel or included in the machining program.

6. Begin machining: The machining process should be carried out in the following sequence:

   - Mill the screw holes with a 2mm end mill and then with a 3mm end mill
   - Mill the corners with a 2mm end mill
   - Mill everything else with a 3mm end mill

By following these steps, you can properly configure the feed rate and the diameter of the end mill of a CNC milling machine for the production of a workpiece. It is important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations and guidelines for the specific CNC milling machine being used, as well as to use proper safety measures while operating the machine.

## PlanktoScope Hat

Welcome to the PCB production manual for the PlanktoScope Hat!

![planktoscope_hat_front.png](../images/hardware/planktoscope_hat_front.png)
![planktoscope_hat_back.png](../images/hardware/planktoscope_hat_back.png)

A [PCB (printed circuit board)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) is a crucial component of many electronic devices, providing a platform for connecting and mounting electronic components. The PCB production process involves several steps, including designing the PCB layout, fabricating the PCB, and assembling the electronic components onto the PCB.

The raw materials used in PCB production include copper sheets, fiberglass sheets, and various chemicals for etching and plating. These materials are used to create the circuitry patterns on the PCB.

There are two main types of electronic components that can be mounted onto a PCB: [thru-hole components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology) and [surface mount components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology). Thru-hole components have leads that are inserted through holes in the PCB and soldered to the other side, while surface mount components are soldered directly onto the surface of the PCB. The choice between thru-hole and surface mount components depends on the specific requirements of the device being produced.

!!! note

    Please note that this document describes a two-part production of the PCB. To reduce costs, the through hole components are assembled manually as described here. Depending on your budget and the services offered by the manufacturing company, this can also be ordered in the production of the PCB.
