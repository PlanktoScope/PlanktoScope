# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project uses [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) with a `YYYY.MM.patch` scheme
for all releases after `v2.3.0`.
All dates in this file are given in the [UTC time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).

## Unreleased

### Added

- (Application) A hardware configuration file for PlanktoScope hardware v2.6, which was previously missing, has been added. It is now the default hardware configuration file for `pscopehat` builds of the PlanktoScope distro.

### Changed

- (System: infrastructure) Forklift has been upgraded from v0.3.1 to v0.4.0, which includes breaking changes to the schema of Forklift repositories and pallets.

### Removed

- (Application: documentation) The offline documentation included on the PlanktoScope now omits the hardware setup guides.

### Fixed

- (Application: GUI) The white balance gains are now only validated and sent to the backend _after_ the user changes focus away from the input field, instead of being validated and sent 300 ms after the user pauses while editing the value in the input field. This prevents the input validation from being run while the user is still editing the value.
- (Application: GUI) In the "Sample" page, when the minimal & maximal fraction size fields and min & max sampling depth fields are both displayed simultaneously, now the adafruithat version of the Node-RED dashboard shows the fraction size fields on one row and the sampling depth fields on another row, rather than showing them in adjacent columns. This way, the adafruithat version of the Node-RED dashboard now matches the layout in the pscopehat version of the Node-RED dashboard.
- (Application: GUI) The "System Monitoring" page now correctly displays the PlanktoScope hardware version in the "Information" panel's "Instrument Type" field.
- (Application: GUI) The "System Monitoring" and "Fluidic Acquisition" pages now display a software version string which is either a tagged version (e.g. `v2023.9.0-beta.1`) when the version is tagged, or else a pseudoversion (e.g. `v2023.9.0-beta.1-36-gf276e84`) which contains an abbreviated commit SHA and a list of the number of commits since the last tagged version. This version string is now also used for the `acq_software` metadata field.
- (Application: GUI) The `process_commit` metadata field is now set once again, though it depends on the new installer script provided by the [github.com/PlanktoScope/install.planktoscope.community] repo.
- (Application: GUI) The `process_source` metadata field is no longer hard-coded in the Node-RED dashboard, though now it depends on the new installer script provided by the [github.com/PlanktoScope/install.planktoscope.community] repo.
- (System: infrastructure) The SD card setup scripts now apply the Forklift pallet in order to create the Docker Compose services and resources ahead-of-time (rather than waiting for the first boot to do that work), so that the first boot of the SD card image will be much faster.
- (System: infrastructure) The distro setup scripts now work even if they are run from a repository downloaded to some place other than `/home/pi/PlanktoScope`.
- (Application: GUI) The landing page now links to the new project documentation site for online documentation, instead of the old project documentation site.

## v2023.9.0-beta.1 - 2023-09-14

### Added

- (System: networking) The PlanktoScope can now also be accessed using the domain name `pkscope.local` from any web browser where `planktoscope.local` previously worked. We recommend using http://pkscope.local instead of http://planktoscope.local to access your PlanktoScope, for consistency with other domain name formats (see the "Changes" section for details).
- (System: administration, networking) In operating system's networking configuration files which have lines which are automatically generated based on the PlanktoScope's machine name, those lines now have accompanying code comments which explain the correct files to edit in order to make changes which will persist across device reboots.
- (System: administration, networking) You can now check the machine name at `/home/pi/.local/etc/machine-name`. It's updated when the PlanktoScope boots.
- (System: administration; Application: GUI) The Node-RED dashboard now provides some context on the "Administration" page for how to access the logs linked to from that page, and which links to use for providing logs on GitHub or Slack.
- (System: administration; Application: GUI) The Node-RED dashboard now provides some additional information about the side-effects of selecting a hardware version on the "Hardware Settings" page, specifically that the white balance settings will be overwritten.

### Changed

- (Major user-facing change; System: networking) The top-level domain for domain names of format `home.planktoscope` and `{machine-name}.planktoscope` (e.g. http://metal-slope-23501.planktoscope) has been changed from `planktoscope` to `pkscope`, so that the domain names are now of format `home.pkscope` and `{machine-name}.pkscope`. Similarly, the machine-specific mDNS name has been changed from format `planktoscope-{machine-name}.local` to `pkscope-{machine-name}.local`.
- (User-facing change; System: networking) The SSIDs of wifi hotspots generated by the PlanktoScope has been changed from the format `PlanktoScope {machine-name}` to the format `pkscope-{machine-name}`. This makes it easier to determine the machine-specific mDNS URL: just add `.local`, to get `pkscope-{machine-name}.local` (e.g. `pkscope-metal-slope-23501.local`).
- (User-facing change; Application: backend) The Python backend now uses the new machine naming scheme everywhere.
- (System: networking) The default hostname and SSID (used only in certain unexpected situations when a machine name cannot be determined) have both been shortened from `planktoscope` to `pkscope`.
- (System: networking) The SSID format is now specified in `/home/pi/.local/etc/hostapd/ssid.snippet`, instead of `/home/pi/.local/bin/update-ssid-machine-name.sh`.

### Deprecated

- (System: networking) The `planktoscope.local` mDNS name is no longer recommended. We will continue to support it for the foreseeable future (and definitely for at least one year), but we recommend using `pkscope.local` or the machine-specific mDNS name (of format `pkscope-{machine-name}.local`) instead.
- (Application: backend) The Python backend's logs still print machine names in the old naming scheme, to help instrument operators with the naming scheme transition (so that they can identify how each machine was renamed). The machine names in this old naming scheme will be removed in a future release - probably the next release.

### Removed

- (System: administration, networking) The auto-generated `/home/pi/.local/etc/cockpit/origins` file has been removed, because it does not need to be persisted after being generated. Instead, a temporary file is generated and removed after being used.
- (System: administration, networking) The default `/home/pi/.local/etc/hosts` file has been removed from the setup files. Instead, it is now automatically generated by the setup scripts.

### Fixed

- (System: networking) The PlanktoScope no longer generates any machine names or SSIDs which are so long that they prevent the wifi hotspot network from being brought up.
- (Application: backend) The segmenter no longer crashes and fails to respond immediately after attempting to start segmentation.
- (Application: preset settings, GUI) The default setting for the pscopehat version of the Node-RED dashboard is now the 300 um capillary, since that version of the hardware is meant to be used with 300 um capillaries. Previously, the default was the 200 um ibidi slide.
- (Application: preset settings) All default settings for all hardware versions now include a default pixel size calibration of 0.75 um/pixel. Previously, the default settings for v2.1 and v2.3 were missing this setting, which would cause the segmenter to crash when processing datasets generated on PlanktoScopes using the v2.1 or v2.3 hardware settings.
- (Application: preset settings, GUI) The Node-RED dashboard now correctly lists the selected hardware version in the "Hardware Settings" page's "Hardware Version" dropdown menu upon startup.
- (Application: GUI) The Node-RED dashboard now (hopefully) is able to determine the camera type from the Python backend.

## v2023.9.0-beta.0 - 2023-09-02

### Added

- (System: networking) Traffic is now routed with Network Address Translation between the Ethernet and Wi-Fi network interfaces. This means that if the PlanktoScope has internet access through an Ethernet connection, it will share that internet access to devices connected to its Wi-Fi hotspot; and if the PlanktoScope has internet access through a Wi-Fi connection, it will share that internet access to devices connected to its Ethernet port.
- (System: networking) Now both `192.168.4.1` and `192.168.5.1` can be used to access your PlanktoScope when your computer is connected directly to it, regardless of whether you are connecting over an Ethernet cable or the PlanktoScope's Wi-Fi hotspot.
- (System: networking) Previously the PlanktoScope could be connected to from `192.168.4.1` (over Wi-Fi, when running in wireless AP mode), `192.168.5.1` (over Ethernet), and `planktoscope.local` (over Wi-Fi or Ethernet, from a client device with mDNS support); this meant that Android devices could only connect to the PlanktoScope at `192.168.4.1`, as they lack mDNS support. Now, client devices - even those without mDNS support - can connect to the PlanktoScope at `home.planktoscope`, and/or URLs like `clear-field-33719.planktoscope` and `planktoscope-clear-field-33719.local` (where `clear-field-33719` is replaced with the PlanktoScope's Raspberry Pi's machine name, which is also part of the name of the PlanktoScope's Wi-Fi network - e.g. "PlanktoScope clear-field-33719").
- (Application: Documentation) An offline copy of the PlanktoScope project documentation is now provided at URL path `/ps/docs/` (so e.g. it's accessible at http://home.planktoscope/ps/docs/)
- (Application: GUI) The Node-RED dashboard's "Hardware Settings" page now includes a drop-down menu item to select "PlanktoScope v2.5" as an allowed hardware version.
- (Application: GUI, administration) The Node-RED dashboard now generates a notification whenever it restarts the Python backend. This provides visibility for the user when changing the hardware version triggers a restart of the Python backend.
- (System: administration, troubleshooting, GUI) A [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) system administration dashboard is now installed and made accessible at URL path `/admin/cockpit/` (so e.g. it's accessible at http://home.planktoscope/admin/cockpit/).
- (System: administration, troubleshooting, GUI) A [filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) instance, allowing you to manage and edit files anywhere in the Raspberry Pi's SD card, is now installed and made accessible at URL path `/admin/fs/` (so e.g. it's accessible at http://home.planktoscope/admin/fs/)
- (System: administration, troubleshooting, GUI) A [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) administration dashboard for Docker is now installed and made accessible at URL path `/admin/portainer/` (so e.g. it's accessible at http://home.planktoscope/admin/portainer/). Note that you will need to open Portainer within a few minutes after booting (or rebooting) your PlanktoScope in order to create an admin account for Portainer.
- (System: administration) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is now installed. We are using it to deliver various applications in a way that will eventually enable safe and easy upgrades.
- (System: administration, troubleshooting) [w3m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m) is now installed, enabling terminal-based interaction with some Wi-Fi network captive portals to obtain internet access on the PlanktoScope. For captive portals which require Javascript, we recommend instead using [browsh](https://www.brow.sh/) as a Docker container; we don't provide browsh in the default SD card image because it adds ~250 MB of dependencies to the image.

### Changed

- (User-facing change; System: administration) The file browser on port 80 for viewing datasets has now been moved to path `/ps/data/browse/` (so e.g. it's accessible at http://home.planktoscope/ps/data/browse/ ), and it is now implemented using [filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser), so that now you can delete folders, download folders, preview images, etc. As before, you can still access this from the "Gallery" page of the Node-RED dashboard.
- (User-facing change; Application: GUI) If you navigate the PlanktoScope in your web browser on port 80 (or without specifying a port) (e.g. with URLs like `http://home.planktoscope` or `http://planktoscope.local`), your browser will show a landing page with a list of links for easy access to the Node-RED dashboard, documentation, other embedded applications, and reference information about your PlanktoScope.
- (User-facing change; Application: GUI) Previously, the Node-RED dashboard was accessed on the path `/ui` on port 1880, e.g. with URLs like `http://planktoscope.local:1880/ui` or `http://192.168.4.1:1880/ui`; now, it should be accessed via a link on the landing page.
- (User-facing change; System: networking) Previously, PlanktoScope machine names were generated as gibberish words like "Babaxio-Detuiau", and the machine names were used as the names of the private Wi-Fi networks generated by the PlanktoScope in wireless AP mode. However, the machine names created by this naming scheme were often difficult to pronounce, remember, and type for people in various languages, and the naming scheme sometimes generated names which sounded like curses or insults in some languages. Now, PlanktoScope machine names are generated as a combination of two words and a number up to five digits long; words are selected from pre-built lists in a language which can be chosen based on localization settings. Currently, word lists are only provided in US English, resulting in names like "metal-slope-23501", "conscious-pocket-1684", and "plant-range-10581"; however, word lists can be added for other languages in the future, and a user interface will eventually be provided for changing localization settings.
- (User-facing change; Application: GUI) Selecting a hardware version on the "Hardware Settings" page of the Node-RED dashboard now causes a default hardware preset for that version to overwrite the entire `hardware.json` file, and the Node-RED dashboard will reload the settings; this prevents the `hardware.json` file from being changed into an inconsistent mixture of settings for different hardware versions, which was the previous (incorrect) behavior. The description on the "Hardware Settings" page is also now more specific about what happens when a hardware version is selected.
- (User-facing change; Application: GUI, troubleshooting) Previously, the Node-RED dashboard's "Administration" page merged log entries from every component of the Python backend and the Node-RED dashboard. Now, the Node-RED dashboard instead displays links to separate Cockpit log-viewing pages (which by default are accessed with username `pi` and password `copepode`) for the Node-RED dashboard, the backend's hardware controller, and the backend's segmenter, and links to filebrowser directories for all log files created by the backend's hardware controller and segmenter.
- (User-facing change; System: GUI) Previously, the Node-RED flow editor was accessed directly on port 1880, e.g. with URLs like `http://planktoscope.local:1880` or `http://192.168.4.1:1880`; now, it should be accessed via a link on the landing page .
- (System: networking) Previously, PlanktoScopes all had `planktoscope` as their hostname. Now, the hostname is of the format `planktoscope-<machine-name>`, e.g. `planktoscope-metal-slope-23501` or `planktoscope-plant-range-10581`.
- (Likely user-facing change; System: networking) The default Wi-Fi country has been changed from `FR` (France) to `US` (USA).
- (Likely user-facing change; System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script considered receiving an IP address assignment from the connected Wi-Fi network as the criterion for determining whether the Wi-Fi connection was successful. Now the autohotspot script tries to ping `google.com` to determine whether the connection was successful, so that the autohotspot script will revert to wireless AP mode if no internet access is available over the Wi-Fi network (e.g. if the connected Wi-Fi network is actually behaving like a captive portal, which would prevent the PlanktoScope from being accessed via a VPN over the internet - in which case the PlanktoScope would become accessible only over an Ethernet cable). This change is meant to make it easier to fix a PlanktoScope's Wi-Fi connection configuration when that configuration makes internet access impossible.
- (System: networking, troubleshooting) Previously the autohotspot script would print the MAC addresses and SSIDs of all Wi-Fi networks found by scanning. Now it only prints the SSIDs of Wi-Fi networks found by scanning and avoids printing duplicate SSIDs, for more concise service logs.
- (System: networking, troubleshooting) When the autohotspot script fails to connect to google.com, it will also print some diagnostic information by attempting to ping `1.1.1.1` (the static IP address of Cloudflare DNS, so a ping without DNS lookup) and checking whether the Wi-Fi network assigned an IP address to the Raspberry Pi, and reporting the results. This enables better troubleshooting of internet access issues on Wi-Fi networks.
- (System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script was run every 5 minutes to scan for available Wi-Fi networks. Now it is run every 2 minutes, so that the PlanktoScope will connect more quickly to a Wi-Fi network which has just appeared.
- (System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script and the dhcpcd service would both try to manage when to start and stop the dnsmasq service. Now, the dnsmasq service always runs. This change was made to simplify the network configuration so that it would be easier to understand, troubleshoot, and maintain.
- (System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script would use a mixture of dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant as entrypoints for Wi-Fi network connection management. Now, dhcpcd is used to manage wpa_supplicant, and the autohotspot script only interacts with dhcpcd. This change was made to simplify the network configuration so that it would be easier to understand, troubleshoot, and maintain. Note that, in the future, wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd may be replaced with [NetworkManager](https://networkmanager.dev/).
- (System: networking) The autohotspot script has undergone a major refactoring, which may accidentally introduce bugs.
- (Application: Backend, GUI) The Node-RED dashboard no longer supervises the Python backend; instead, it delegates that work to systemd.
- (Application: Backend) Log files from the Python backend are no longer saved to `/home/pi`, but instead to subdirectories for the backend components under `/home/pi/device-backend-logs`. Note: the locations of log files may be changed again in the future, and/or file logging may be changed to use a different systemd-based mechanism in the future.
- (System) The `/usr/bin/stepper-disable` and `/usr/bin/autohotspotN` scripts have been moved to `/home/pi/.local/bin/release-gpio-steppers.sh` and `/home/pi/.local/bin/autohotspot.sh`, respectively.
- (System) The `gpio-init.service` systemd service has been renamed to `planktoscope-org.init-gpio-steppers.service`.
- (System) Previously the `en_DK.UTF-8` locale was used for everything. Now it is only used for time, measurements, and paper dimensions, and the `en_US.UTF-8` locale is the base locale for everything else. In the future we may provide GUI functionality for changing the base locale.
- (System) The chrony configuration has been simplified, but it may be broken.
- (System) The default timezone is now officially set to UTC, and we will be using UTC as the standard system time zone for all PlanktoScopes. Previously, the pre-built SD card images provided by this project used UTC as the timezone, but the "Expert Setup" instructions for manually setting up the PlanktoScope software did not specify a time zone to use.
- (System, Dependencies) The base OS is now the 2023-05-03 release of Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye.
- (Application: Backend, Dependencies) The Python backend and Node-RED dashboard's indirect dependencies are now version-locked to improve the reproducibility of the OS setup script independently of when the script is run.

### Deprecated

- (Application: GUI) In a future release (potentially as early as v2023.12.0), the Node-RED editor and Node-RED dashboard will not be accessible at all over port 1880. In this release, you can still access the Node-RED dashboard at path `/ps/node-red-v2/ui` on port 1880, but the embedded image streams and file gallery will not be properly displayed; and you can access the Node-RED editor at path `/admin/ps/node-red-v2` on port 1880. However, you should instead access the Node-RED editor and Node-RED dashboard via the links on the PlanktoScope's landing page.
- (Application: GUI) In a future release (timeline not yet decided), the version of the Node-RED dashboard for the Adafruit HAT will stop receiving new features even as the version of the Node-RED dashboard for the custom PlanktoScope HAT continues receiving new features. However, we will continue to fix bugs in the Node-RED dashboard for the Adafruit HAT, and we will continue to build SD card images for the Adafruit HAT which will also include new features in other software components.

### Removed

- (User-facing removal; Application: GUI) The Node-RED dashboard no longer allows selection of "PlanktoScope v1.0" or "PlanktoScope v2.2 (waveshare HAT)" as the hardware version. Those hardware versions are no longer supported by the software.
- (User-facing removal; System: networking) Now `planktoscope.local` only works for devices connected directly to the PlanktoScope, either via an Ethernet cable or over Wi-Fi when the PlanktoScope is running in wireless AP mode. `planktoscope.local` no longer works on other networks, such as LANs or mesh VPNs, which the PlanktoScope might be connected to. On such networks, the machine-specific mDNS name (of format `planktoscope-<machine-name>.local`) should be used instead.
- (System: administration) The Git-based software update system (exposed in the Node-RED dashboard's "Adminisration" page) has been removed, since it was reported to behave problematically anyways. In the future, we will use a system based on Docker for safer and easier software updates.

### Fixed

- (Major fault-tolerance improvement; Application: GUI) When an invalid value is entered for the red or blue white balance gain on the Node-RED dashboard's "Optic Configuration" page, that value is now ignored, a notification is displayed about the invalid value, and the white balance gain is reset to the last valid value (loaded from the `hardware.json` configuration file). This fixes [issue #166](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/PlanktoScope/issues/166) by preventing the Node-RED dashboard from saving an invalid value to the `hardware.json` file, which would crash the Python hardware controller after the next boot (or after the next time the Python hardware controller was restarted).
- (Major quality-of-life improvement; Backend: dependencies) The `adafruit-blinka` and `adafruit-platformdetect` dependencies are now updated to their latest version, so that Python hardware controller will work on PlanktoScopes with recent (i.e. post-2021) versions of the Adafruit HAT.
- (Application: GUI, troubleshooting) Previously, the Node-RED dashboard would often fail to display the log output from the Python backend. Now, it should always make the logs accessible (either by the links to Cockpit log viewer or by the links to the log file browser).
- (System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script would not ignore any networks which were commented out in the `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` file when checking if any networks found by scanning matched networks were specified in the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file; now it ignores them, so that commented-out networks don't incorrectly prevent the autohotspot from going into wireless AP mode.
- (System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script would always wait 20 seconds after attempting to connect to a Wi-Fi network before checking whether the connection was successful, even if it didn't actually need to wait 20 seconds. Now the autohotspot script repeatedly attempts to ping google.com with a timeout of 2 seconds per attempt and a maximum of 10 attempts, so that the autohotspot script only waits as long as a necessary to determine that a Wi-Fi network connection has succeeded.
- (System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script could decide that the SSID scan results were available even if no SSIDs were found (despite local Wi-Fi networks being active). Now an empty SSID scan result is treated as a condition where a re-scan is required.
- (System: networking) Previously the log messages from the autohotspot script had inconsistent capitalization and grammar, and slightly unclear wording. Those have now been made more clear and consistent.
