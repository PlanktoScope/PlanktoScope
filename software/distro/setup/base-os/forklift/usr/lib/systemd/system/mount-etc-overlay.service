[Service]
# This is implemented as a service rather than a mount because we're bind-mounting from /etc to
# /usr/etc and then mounting /etc as an overlay, and systemd's implicit dependencies with mounts
# would cause a circular requirement dependency; and keeping everything in one unit makes the order
# of operations clearer.

# Changes to /etc/machine-id should be committed directly to the underlay;

# Note: `umount -l` is not recommended in general (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/390057)
# because it just removes the mounts from the namespace while writes to open files can continue;
# however, this is probably acceptable behavior for the overlay at shutdown, because any writes
# will be in our upperdir anyways.
