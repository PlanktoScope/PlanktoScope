[Service]
# This is implemented as a service rather than a mount so that we can have a unit name which isn't
# bound to the home directory of a specific user.

# Note: `umount -l` is not recommended in general (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/390057)
# because it just removes the mounts from the namespace while writes to open files can continue;
# however, we have a read-only mount so it doesn't matter
