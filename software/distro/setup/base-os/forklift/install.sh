# Forklift package deployments of Docker containerized applications, OS config files, and systemd
# system services for the PlanktoScope software distribution. This script integrates that pallet
# into the PlanktoScope OS's filesystem by installing Forklift and providing some systemd units
# which set up bind mounts and overlay filesystems to bootstrap the configs managed by Forklift.
