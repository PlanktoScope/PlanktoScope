# Note: cache-img downloads images even for disabled package deployments. We skip it to save disk
# space (because the node-red container image used by a test package is >100 MB, even though we
# don't need it yet), we don't yet have any packages in the pallet which someone might want to
# enable, and because we're running plt apply anyways - that command will download images as needed
# for each (enabled) package deployment. We will want to have a cache-img flag which controls
# whether only enabled package deployments are cached or all package deployments are cached, so that
# we can use the command here to only cache enabled package deployments. We may get a slight speedup
# if we can download all the images in parallel, without having to start the services all in
# parallel (which would add lots of runtime nondeterminism to the system)
# sudo -E $forklift --workspace $workspace plt cache-img
sudo -E $forklift --workspace $workspace plt apply
# Note: we apply the pallet immediately so that the first boot of the image won't be excessively
# slow (due to Docker Compose needing to create all the services from scratch rather than simply
# starting them).

# Apply pallet after Docker is initialized, because the system needs to be restarted after Docker is
# installed before the Docker service will be able to start successfully.
