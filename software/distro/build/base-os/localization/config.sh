# units are metric, and paper sizes are international.
# FIXME: https://wiki.debian.org/Locale#Standard recommends that instead we should actually set the
# default locale to "None" - so that users who access the system over SSH can set their own locale
# using the LANG environment variable. However, the PlanktoScope's Node-RED frontend is probably
# relying on system commands using the default locale, so we still need to set a non-"None" locale
# until we clean up the PlanktoScope's Node-RED frontend to run command with a locale environment
# variable set, e.g. `LANG=en_DK.UTF-8 date`, or ultimately to run commands without relying on
# locales, e.g. using formatting strings to get a system date. Afterwards, we can just set the
# default locale to None using the command`sudo update-locale --reset`.
