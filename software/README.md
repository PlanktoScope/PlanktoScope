# software

This directory will eventually contain some software components related to the PlanktoScope software distribution; note that specific programs may be managed in separate repositories. Currently, this directory contains:

- Setup scripts (in `distro/setup`) for the PlanktoScope OS.
- The PlanktoScope OS's Node-RED dashboard (in `node-red-dashboard`)

TODO: write a guide to the places where other parts of the PlanktoScope OS can be found.
