# Library for exchaning messages with Node-RED
# We are using MQTT V3.1.1
# The documentation for Paho can be found here:
# https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/docs/

# MQTT Topics follows this architecture:
# - actuator :  This topic adresses the stepper control thread
#               No publication under this topic should happen from Python
#   - actuator/pump :   Control of the pump
#                       The message is a json object
#                       {"action":"move", "direction":"FORWARD", "volume":10, "flowrate":1}
#                       to move 10mL forward at 1mL/min
#                       action can be "move" or "stop"
#                       Receive only
#   - actuator/focus :  Control of the focus stage
#                       The message is a json object, speed is optional
#                       {"action":"move", "direction":"UP", "distance":0.26, "speed":1}
#                       to move up 10mm
#                       action can be "move" or "stop"
#                       Receive only
# - imager/image :      This topic adresses the imaging thread
#                       Is a json object with
#                       {"action":"image","sleep":5,"volume":1,"nb_frame":200}
#                       sleep in seconds, volume in mL
#                       Receive only
# - segmenter/segment : This topic adresses the segmenter process
#                       Is a json object with
#                       {"action":"segment"}
#                       Receive only
# - status :    This topics sends feedback to Node-Red
#               No publication or receive at this level
#   - status/pump :     State of the pump
#                       Is a json object with
#                       {"status":"Start", "time_left":25}
#                       Status is one of Started, Ready, Done, Interrupted
#                       Publish only
#   - status/focus :    State of the focus stage
#                       Is a json object with
#                       {"status":"Start", "time_left":25}
#                       Status is one of Started, Ready, Done, Interrupted
#                       Publish only
#   - status/imager :   State of the imager
#                       Is a json object with
#                       {"status":"Start", "time_left":25}
#                       Status is one of Started, Ready, Completed or 12_11_15_0.1.jpg has been imaged.
#                       Publish only
#   - status/segmenter :   Status of the segmentation
#       - status/segmenter/name
#       - status/segmenter/object_id
#       - status/segmenter/metric

# TODO Evaluate the opportunity of saving the last x received messages in a queue for treatment
# We can use collections.deque https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque
