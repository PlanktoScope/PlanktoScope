Ecotaxa Export archive format
In a folder place:

image files

    Colour and 8-bits greyscale images are supported, in jpg, png,gif (possibly animated) formats.
a tsv (TAB separated file) which can be .txt or .tsv extension. File name must start with ecotaxa (ecotaxa*.txt or ecotaxa*.tsv)

    It contains the metadata for each image. This file can be created in a spreadsheet application (see formats and examples below).

        Line 1 contains column headers
        Line 2 contains data format codes; [f] for floats, [t] for text
        Line 3...n contain data for each image

The metadata and data for each image is organised in various levels (image, object, process, sample, etc.). All column names must be prefixed with the level name (img_***, object_***, etc.). Some common fields, used to filter data, must be named and sometimes formatted in a certain way (required format in blue), which is documented below. But, overall, the only two mandatory fields are img_file_name and object_id (in red).

    IMAGE
        img_file_name [t]: name of the image file in the folder (including extension)
        img_rank [f] : rank of image to be displayed, in case of existence of multiple (<10) images for one object. Starts at 1.
    OBJECT: one object to be classified, usually one organism. One object can be represented by several images. In this tsv file, there is one line per image which means the object data gets repeated on several lines.
        object_id [t] : identifier of the object, must be unique in the project. It will be displayed in the object page
        object_link [f] : URL of an associated website
        object_lat [f] : latitude, decimal degrees
        object_lon [f] : longitude, decimal degrees
        object_date [f] : ISO8601 YYYYMMJJ UTC
        object_time [f] : ISO8601 HHMMSS UTC
        object_depth_min [f] : minimum depth of object, meters
        object_depth_max [f] : maximum depth of object, meters
    And, for already classified objects
        object_annotation_date [t] : ISO8601 YYYYMMJJ UTC
        object_annotation_time [t] : ISO8601 YYYYMMJJ UTC
        object_annotation_category [t] : class of the object with optionally its direct parent following separated by left angle bracket without whitespace "Cnidaria<Hydrozoa" or old style between brackets "Cnidaria (Hydrozoa)"
        object_annotation_category_id [f] : Ecotaxa ID of the class of the object, generally from an Ecotaxa export
        object_annotation_person_name [t] : name of the person who identified the object
        object_annotation_person_email [t] : email of the person who identified the object
        object_annotation_status [t] : predicted, dubious, or validated
    And additional object-related fields
        object_*** [f] or [t] : other fields relative to the object. Up to 500 [f] fields and 20 [t] ones.
    PROCESS: metadata relative to the processing of the raw images
        process_id [t] : identifier. The processing information is associated with the acquisition on the same line. If missing, a dummy processing identifier will be created.
        process_*** [t] : other fields relative to the process. Up to 30 of them.
    ACQUISITION: metadata relative to the image acquisition
        acq_id [t] : identifier of the image acquisition, must be unique in the project. If missing, a dummy acquisition identifier will be created.
        acq_instrument [t] : name of the instrument (UVP, ZOOSCAN, FLOWCAM, etc.)
        acq_*** [t] : other fields relative to the acquisition. Up to 30 of them.
    SAMPLE: a collection event
        sample_id [t] : identifier of the sample, must be unique in the project. If missing, a dummy sample identifier will be created.
        sample_*** [t] : other fields relative to the sample. Up to 30 of them.
