"""stopflow provides the domain logic for stop-flow imaging.

No actual I/O (hardware control, filesystem interaction, or MQTT messaging) should be added to this
module; instead, I/O drivers should be defined elsewhere and passed into functions/methods in this
module. This will allow us to write automated tests for the domain logic for stop-flow imaging
which we can run without a PlanktoScope.
